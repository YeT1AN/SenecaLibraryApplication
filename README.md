- C++: The core programming language used for implementing the entire system.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The system employs OOP principles to organize code into classes and objects, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- File I/O: Publications and library data are stored and retrieved using file input and output operations.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): Users interact with the system through a command-line interface, allowing for easy navigation and input.
- Code Versioning: GitHub is utilized for version control, collaborative development, and project management.
- Streamable Interface: The Streamable interface is employed for efficient reading and writing of data to and from files.
